extend support to PalestineThe Thangal said the Palestinian people had been resisting the invasion attempts by Israel since 1947 “Their land properties everything is being taken over and they are displaced from their land Resistance has been their oxygen for long A wellknown Palestinian poet has described his people as dead bodies that breathe” he saidThe IUML leader pointed out that India had been supporting them after realising Israel’s hidden agenda of invasion “People like Mahatma Gandhi father of our nation have criticised the invasion Prime Ministers from Nehru to Manmohan Singh continued that line Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee was supporting Palestine The current dispensation at the Centre however has diluted our position and is seen whitewashing Israel It is condemnable” he saidTerming Israel “the biggest terrorist nation in the world” the Thangal said countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom were found to be supporting it These Western nations which always talk about human rights were turning a blind eye towards what was happening in Gaza “A free Palestine is the only solution for which political talks should be held Israel should stop its terrorist activities and fall in line” he addedThousands of people including a large number of women from across northern Kerala districts gathered on the beach to attend the event which also proved

The national capital's air quality index rose to as high as 346 early on Monday, the highest among 110 global cities tracked by IQ Air. Several factors such as stubble burning, pollution from vehicles, construction and coal-fired power plants contributed to this. Anju Goel, an air quality research fellow at The The Energy and Resources Institute, told Bloomberg that the poor AQI is due to a drop in temperature and slow wind speeds which affected the dispersal of pollution.

On 18 March 2024, Israeli forces conducted an overnight raid on Al-Shifa hospital following intel that senior Hamas officials had regrouped and were using the hospital to command attacks. After a two week siege that ended on 1 April 2024, the Al-Shifa hospital was mostly destroyed,and hundreds of dead Palestinians were found in and around the hospital, including in mass graves.Al-Shifa is the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip; it was originally a British army barracks but was converted into a hospital in 1946.Hamas presence in the hospital during the 2014 Gaza War is disputed. Israel has stated that the hospital was a Hamas control and command centre, and The Washington Post reported it had become a de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders, who can be seen in the hallways and offices.By contrast, doctors Erik Fosse and Mads Gilbert, who were working at the hospital, stated that they did not see any evidence of military activity at the hospital during the war.[69][70] Professor Sara Roy stated that military use of the hospital was highly improbable. Amnesty International reported in 2015 that Hamas had used abandoned areas of the hospital to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise ill-treat suspects while the hospital was operational.The Israeli military had ordered all civilians in the region to evacuate on 13 October.[73] The IDF reported that Hamas was preventing the evacuation of civilians from the area and particularly from Al Shifa hospital, with the IDF stating that Hamas was using civilians as human shields.The IDF again requested all civilians in Northern Gaza and specifically Al-Shifa hospital to evacuate on 9 November. Thousands of displaced civilians were sheltering in the hospital at the time of the attacks on 11 November.\",\n",

League IUML State president has called Israel a “terrorist nation” for its massacre of the hapless Palestinian people in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7He was opening an event organised by the IUML on the Kozhikode beach on Thursday to extend support to PalestineThe Thangal said the Palestinian people had been resisting the invasion attempts by Israel since 1947 “Their land properties everything is being taken over and they are displaced from their land Resistance has been their oxygen for long A wellknown Palestinian poet has described his people as dead bodies that breathe” he saidThe IUML leader pointed out that India had been supporting them after realising Israel’s hidden agenda of invasion “People like Mahatma Gandhi father of our nation have criticised the invasion Prime Ministers from Nehru to Manmohan Singh continued that line Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee was supporting Palestine The current dispensation at the Centre however has diluted our position and is seen whitewashing Israel It is condemnable” he saidTerming Israel “the biggest terrorist nation in the world” the Thangal said countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom were found to be supporting it These Western nations which always talk about human rights were turning a blind eye towards what was happening in Gaza “A free Palestine is the only solution for which political talks should be held Israel should stop its terrorist activities and fall in line” he addedThousands of people including a large number of women from across northern Kerala districts gathered on the beach to attend the event which also proved to be a show of strength of the IUML ahead of the Lok Sabha polls The party’s elected representatives including MPs and MLAs were present', 'question': 'Who
